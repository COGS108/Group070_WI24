    "How have abortion rates changed in response to changes in various factors - such as the representation of female politicians, access to obstetric and gynecological (OB/GYN) care, and income levels - in the USA from 2000-2020? How will these factors help us predict future abortion rates in the foreseeable future?\n"

    "To be more specific in our research, the definition in which we are abiding by the term “women in governing bodies” are women who are in the respective current state legislature. Throughout our data we will look at all U.S. territories excluding Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. However, we will be using 3 states as markers and general comparisons to the data: 1) having the highest percentage of women in their state legislature, 2) having the lowest percentage of women in their state legislature, and 3) having the median percentage of women in their state legislature. While proceeding with our research, if we have the time and data to do so, we would love to delve deeper into any possible outliers within the states. 
One of the first considerations to be made is which states have higher female representation and which have less. We can note that in all 50 states males are over represented while females are underrepresented.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This data splits the measures into two separate categories; state legislatures. Overall Vermont, Maine, and Rhode Island notably have the smallest disparities, while North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska have the highest. 
A study done by the National Partnership for Women & Families<a name=\"cite_note-2\"></a> [^](#cite_ref-2) states with a higher representation of female legislators are more likely to adopt abortion protection policies. This study considers 2 categories of representation in legislation: states where women make up more than a third of the members, and states where women make up less than a third of members. They found that of the prior, 84% of these states have policies that support abortion access while the former only has 15%. They also consider how the ethnic diversity in these women may also correlate. 
Subsequently, female health is a very general statement, therefore we decided to focus on OB/GYN access. We believe that this may yield some type of correlation between abortion rates. We believe that there will be some type of existing correlation between this accessibility and abortion rates. Additionally, another factor that we must consider are average income rates. In the article, Rural-urban differences in access to hospital obstetric and neonatal care: how far is the closest one?, their general conclusion is that: “Women in communities that are already socioeconomically disadvantaged face increasing and substantial travel distances to access perinatal care.”<a name=\"cite_note-3\"></a> [^](#cite_ref-3) (Hung et al.)
